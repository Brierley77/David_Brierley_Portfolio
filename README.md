My data science and data analytics projects. 



# [Project 1 - Titanic Data Set - Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Brierley77/Titanic-Data-Set/blob/main/Titanic%20Submission%20.ipynb)
Here I implemented logistic regression to the Titanic Data Set, to try and predict whether individuals on board were likely to survive or not, depending on a number of variables. 

I started with a little bit of EDA, setting myself 5 key questions. These surrounded percentage of survival, gender and class splits. 
After this initial EDA I jumped into cleaning the data. Most of the cleaning was making sure I had no nulls. I had to implament some averages if certain data points were missing. 

I ran my logistic regression on 6 variables first, then I dropped columns and focused on 4 variables. 
My model predicted all who survived and all who didn't.

I set myself this challenge for the well known kaggle competition.

# [Project 2 - Lego Analysis Project](https://github.com/Brierley77/Lego_Analysis_Project/blob/main/Lego%20Analysis%20Project%20.ipynb)
Setting myself some more 'realistic' data science problems and questions to solve. This analysis followed a youtube tutorial. Was a great learning experience as I set myself the challenge to find the solution myself first and if needed, follow along with the solution. Downloaded the data straight from Gitbhub.

# [Project 3.1 - Web-Scraping - Learning Basic Principles](https://github.com/Brierley77/Web_Scraping/blob/main/Web%20Scraping%20.ipynb)
# [Project 3.2 - Web-Scraping - Continued Learning](https://github.com/Brierley77/Web_Scraping/blob/main/Web%20Scraping%20.ipynb)
The first notebook 'Web Sraping' is me following a website tutorial. I am just keeping it simple here to understand the basics.

The second 'Own Web Scraping' is myself pushing my learning by trying to webscrape a real website for weather data. This is still on-going. I am trying to increase my webscraping skills to start gathering some really nice datasets of my own. This is an ongoing project that I am going to try and run everyday / ever couple of days to build my own weather data base. I am going to try and learn how to then push this into my own SQL database.

# [Project 4 - Dashboarding](https://github.com/Brierley77/PowerBi-Dashboarding/blob/main/House%20Data%20Dashboard.pdf)
Here I set myself the challenge of producing better, more appealing dashboards. I used the KC_Housing data set for this dashboard and wanted to be able to showcase what the majority of KPI dashboards / general dashboarding showcases. Including a bunch of important / key visuals, some sort of filter (floors), different plots inclusing line graphs, bar graphs and scatter plots. It is a personal goal of mine to keep pushing my skills with PowerBi as well as Tableau.
